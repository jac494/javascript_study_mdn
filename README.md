# Javascript Study

For a variety of reasons I wanted to go through an overview of Javascript and web dev. It's not something I interact with often since my career has been mostly focused on backend infra, but relevant JS things come up sometimes and it's been years since I've had any earnest look at JS or web dev.

I might use more than MDN but those docs seem like a great place to start.
